# Primary Objectives:
## Reduce clientBoundingRect calls
  - [x] Only update window bounds on scroll or resize event. Only if we have passive listeners to detect any user interaction.
  - [x] Passive listeners are only needed where the callback can preventDefault()
  - [x] Cache the window bounds, not the entire boudingRect object
  - [x] Heuristics to avoid polling when we believe the system to be stable

## Support scrolling divs
  - [x] Allow manual declaration of root element

## Tests
  - [x] Migrate unit tests from Phantom to Headless Chrome
  - [x] Fix leaky tests

## Perf
  - [x] Address issues with excessive CPU usage and layout thrash
  - [x] Address issues with legacy MS browsers and `getBoundingClientRect`
  - [x] Leverage IntersectionObserver where available and only poly filling to rAF when needed.
  - [x] Include an `isDirty` and `invalidate` API for State Changes 
  - [x] Strip Ember-Spaniel to be only the viewport observation code, native intersection observer + poly
  - [x] Ember-Spaniel remove initializer https://github.com/asakusuma/ember-spaniel/issues/22#issuecomment-355101616 since `setGlobalEngine` won't be a thing anymore

## Maintenance 
  - [x] Initial upgrade of all dependencies

## Engine
  - [x] Propose extracting the read/write functionality into Backburner. This will provide more performant batching of DOM reads/writes explicitly from Backburner. https://github.com/BackburnerJS/backburner.js/issues/345
  - [x] Remove “Engine” and relative engine methods from API and logic
  - [x] Make `run.join` pluggable within Spaniel#Engine with a hard dependency on Backburner. 

# Secondary and Legacy Objectives:
(most of these won't be included within the initial v4 release)
## Heuristics
  - [ ] Extract the event handling stuff (Utility API) into its own library (which will replace Ember-Singularity)

## Tests
  - [ ] Migrate headless browser tests from Electron/Nightmare to Headless Chrome + Puppeteer

## Legacy Burndown Tasks from v3
  - [ ] rAF
  - [ ] Way to wrap work queue (ember-spaniel can use this instead of clobering the default engine) (we dont need to wrap read)
  - [ ] Allow hook for host to specify when objects can be resized
  - [ ] Pass in IntersectionObserver. This forces users to import polyfill if needed and allows per-browser builds to take advantage of native IntersectionObserver
  - [ ] Include an `onMutate` event for DOM and State Changes
  - [ ] Support per browser builds
  - [ ] Self contained Spaniel instance
  - [ ] Stop exposing IntersectionObserver directly
  - [ ] Stop exposing the global scheduler
  - [ ] Prevent Native and Poly IntersectionObserver from accessing the Ember Run Loop
