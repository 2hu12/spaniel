## Reduce clientBoundingRect calls
  - [x] Only update window bounds on scroll or resize event. Only if we have passive listeners to detect any user interaction.
  - [x] Passive listeners are only needed where the callback can preventDefault()
  - [x] Cache the window bounds, not the entire boudingRect object
  - [x] Heuristics to avoid polling when we believe the system to be stable

## Support scrolling divs
  - [x] Allow manual declaration of root element

## Tests
  - [] Migrate headless browser tests from Electron/Nightmare to Headless Chrome + Puppeteer
  - [x] Migrate unit tests from Phantom to Headless Chrome
  - [x] Fix leaky tests

## Perf
  - [x] Address issues with excessive CPU usage and layout thrash
  - [x] Address issues with legacy MS browsers and `getBoundingClientRect`

## Maintenance 
  - [x] Initial upgrade of all dependencies

## Engine
  - [x] Hard dependency with Backburner. Extracts the read/write functionality. This will provide more performant batching of DOM reads/writes explicitly from Backburner.
  - [x] Remove “Engine” and relative engine methods from API and logic. Make `run.join` pluggable within Spaniel#Engine

## Heuristics
  - [] Extract the viewport observation code into its own library
  - [] Extract the event handling stuff (Utility API) into its own library

## Host interface
  - [] rAF
  - [] Way to wrap work queue (ember-spaniel can use this instead of clobering the default engine) (we dont need to wrap read)
  - [] Allow hook for host to specify when objects can be resized
  - [] Pass in IntersectionObserver. This forces users to import polyfill if needed and allows per-browser builds to take advantage of native IntersectionObserver
  - [] Leverage IntersectionObserver where available and only poly filling to rAF when needed.
  - [] Include an `onMutate` event for DOM and State Changes
  - [] Support per browser builds
  - [] Self contained Spaniel instance
  - [] Stop exposing IntersectionObserver directly
  - [] Stop exposing the global scheduler
  - [] Prevent Native and Poly IntersectionObserver from accessing the Ember Run Loop
